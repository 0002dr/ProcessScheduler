ProcessScheduler
================

This program simulates the allocation of jobs to a single processor over time, using each of four algorithms: FCFS, round-robin, SJN, and SRT.

-	The program will read a file describing a number of jobs, their arrival times, and their execution durations. 
-	The following metrics are calculated and placed into a single file which can be imported into a program like Excel (tabular form):
    1. Wait time (time between arrival and first execution) of each job
    2. Turnaround time (time between arrival and completion) of each job
    3. Average wait time of all jobs
    4. Average turnaround time of all jobs
    5. Standard deviation of wait times of all jobs
    6. Standard deviation of turnaround times of all jobs
